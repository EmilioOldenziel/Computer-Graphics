This is a README file

When submitting your assignment, describe (briefly) the changes you made and what difficulties you encountered in this file.

Also describe what controls (key short-cuts, mouse clicks, mouse movement etc) and possible bonus assignments you implemented, so we can check them more easily.

If you have any suggestions/feedback for improving the practical assignments or support from teaching assistants, you may include it here OR post in anonymously on Nestor under Feedback.

Part 1.
    We changed the mainwindow and added buffers, uniforms and implemented drawing of the model so that we could get our first image of the cube.
    Then we implemented the vertex shader and fragment shader to display the colors of the triangles.
    After that we used rotations and translations to rotate and scale the model using mouse inputs.

    Dragging on the view makes the view (camera) rotate around the model. Using the scoll wheel scales the model.

Part 2.
    First we implemented the drawing the sphere at the right positions doing a translation, render the sphere at its position 
    and then undo the translation and go to the next sphere so that all spheres are rendered in the end.
    The result is shown in screenshot flat_spheres.jpeg

    After that we had to implement phong in the fragment shader, first we added uniforms for normals, lighting and material.
    The normals have to be interpolated through the pipeline from the vector shader to the fragment shader.
    Non the less we implement it in the fragmentshader and let the normals be interpolated the image looks like it has gouroud shading.
    We emailed about the problem but didnt receive an answer (yet). 
    We thing this had to do with the normal matrix but this part is not so clear in the assignment.
